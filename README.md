<h1>Emily Morgan's First Unstyled Crack at a Chat Application</h1>

<h2>How to get the 'ole train wreck started</h2>

## Project setup (get the node modules going)
```
npm install
```

### Get the back end connected :
```
npm run deploy
```
### If "npm run deploy" fails at the "&" connector. Open a second bash window to get the front-end running 
```
cd chatapp_front
npm run serve
```

### How to Use?
```
Fristly, open the link npm run serve gives you.
Secondly, It's a chat app. You chat of course. 
```

### Built with:
Vue </br>
js </br>

### Built by:
Emily's brain operating at 4% efficiency (maximum capacity apprently)

### Issues of Note:
In uploading to github wires were crossed, dogs barked, files fell into mordor. Had to restart the project from week 2 class videos this Monday. Coding is pain.
